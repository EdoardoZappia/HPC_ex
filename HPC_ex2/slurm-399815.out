slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 399815 ON thin007 CANCELLED AT 2024-04-06T17:25:12 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[47548,0],0] on node thin007
  Remote daemon: [[47548,0],2] on node thin009

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
